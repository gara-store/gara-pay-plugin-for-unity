in the PaymentSystem script, the importants informations to change are : 

 **** public string platform = "MINI_CUP";
 platform, you must replace it with the name of the game

 **** public string returnUrl = "https://mini-coupe.gara.store/"; 
 this is the url that will be launched after payment, you can leave it empty.

 **** public int amount = 0; //The price, minimum 200 
 This is the purchase price, and you must enter it!  
 if the purchasing system is located in another scene, you can store the amount in a playerpref type int “amount”.
